Welcome to WIQ, your gateway to a world of knowledge exploration! üöÄ

### Getting Started:
A quick start is using docker compose, so all containers will be created automatically. The web application is hosted on the port 3000 whereas the gateway service is in 8000.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_en1a.git
docker compose --profile dev up --build
```
