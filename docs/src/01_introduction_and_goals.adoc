== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals,
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
In these points, the main goals and functional requirements will be explained. In order to give context on how the webapp will be developed.

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

****
The functional requirements have been grouped into the different microservices the web application will have.
==== User and Authorization Services
[decimal]
. The User service allows the user to
[arabic]
.. Register.
.. Delete the account.
.. Update the account.
.. Recover the password.
. The authorization service allows the user to 
[arabic]
.. Log in.
.. Log out.
. A user can retrieve the following information from the User service
[arabic]
.. Name.
.. Email.
.. Profile picture.
.. Questions answered.
. The system must be able to manage the user's access to the system.

==== Question Service
[decimal, start=5]
. The Question service retrieves questions generated from wikidata.
. A user can retrieve the following information from the Question service
[arabic]
.. Select a category.
.. Select a difficulty.
.. Select a question.
.. Select an answer.
. Questions must be stored in a database.
. The database used is MongoDB.
. Questions are classified by
[arabic]
.. Category.
.. Difficulty.
. The questions should be selected randomly.
=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****
[options="header", cols="1,1"]
|===
| Goal | Description
| Testability |Test will be developed, so the application has a good quality.

| Usability | The application has to be intuitive for its users.

| Portability | The application works in different devices and browsers. With different screen sizes.

| Performance | The application can handle a big number of users and give good response times.

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
