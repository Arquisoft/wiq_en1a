== Architecture Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.

|===
| What we have to decide | Options/Proposals - Reasoning  | Status | Decision - Reasoning
| Which cloud service provider to use for deploying the webapp
| *Oracle Cloud* - We have access to a VM with this provider with 24/7 free activity
| Decided
| *Oracle Cloud* - All advantages

| Infrastructure design
| Oracle ARM VM with multiple containers inside - Running containers in this VM is free
| Decided
| Oracle ARM VM with multiple containers inside - It is free

| What CI/CD pipeline should we use
| *Github Actions* - Already integrated in the project and fits perfectly our needs for deployment, developing and testing.
  *Azure DevOps* - It is more integrated with Azure cloud, where we could have our infraestructure deployed with Terraform using IaC.
| Pending
| Azure Devops would be a better approach for deploying our infraestructure in Azure containers (serverless) using IaC with Terraform, but there is a lack of time for migrating and GitHub Actions is already integrated and working fine.

| Local or cloud data base
| *Local* - There is no need to externalize things that should keep local.
| Decided
| Local database - Database is kept in local for security reasons and for not overdesigning the infraestructure

| New microservice for Rankings
| Removing ranking logic from users microservice - It might be a better design as user logic and ranking logic is not exactly the same.
| Decided
| Keep rankings logic in users microservice - It would make sense to separate services if they scaled too much but in this project this would be overdesign.

| Which technologies are we going to use for developing the front end
| React - It is a modern framework which is easy to learn and provides usefull predefined components that save time
| Decided
| React - We have a reference already implemented and its capabilities are what we need
