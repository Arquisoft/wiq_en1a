== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== _Microservice based system_

Different business functionallities will be developed in different independent services.
This will ensure that if one of them fails, the rest are still working (For example,
if the rankings go down that will not affect the main game) as they have their own deployment
as well. 
Other benefits are increased maintainability due to separation in small, more readable modules
and the possibillity of using different languages or technologies for each module if needed/prefered 
without colliding with the rest.


=== _Gateway service routing_

We will use a speciallized service that will route the requests to the corresponding service, acting as 
a single entry point for the application. Requests to the services are much simpler as only the api base 
endpoint and the action needs to be known and the gateway can also act as a filter to manage requests 
conditionally if needed. This approach also favors security as we can control which requests are actually 
sent based on its content or the context of the app.
